Space Tolerant CSV Formatter

## Features

In "character seperadet files" ... which means csv-files with a character (selmicolon at the moment) as seperator,
the file can look ugly in text editors. So if you allow spaces in each cell (which i call "scsv"), this pugin can be
used to format those files.
